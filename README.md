# difftective

_difference + detective = difftective_

`difftective` is a tool for detecting visual differences in images/PDFs.

## Examples

Document looking like the same? No update history? Find visual differences with `difftective`:

_Note: There are other services which provide text diff for PDFs; `difftective`, however provides an easy way to detect changes through visual differences._

| expected | actual | diff |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![Old Document](examples/policy/test-policy-old.png) | ![New Document](examples/policy/test-policy-new.png) | ![Diff Document](examples/policy/diff.png) |

On a [classic Mapbox example](https://github.com/mapbox/pixelmatch):
